Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Manager

0.4.5

0.4.4 2010-10-29T17:59:12
      - Updated `Makefile` example in /howto.
      - Updated meta spec URL in /howto.

0.4.3 2010-10-24T21:32:59
      - Fixed internal server error on /howto page. Turns out that
        Data::Section isn't too fork safe when subclasses are loaded in a
        child thread. So moved the howto body into the normal locale
        lexicon.
      - Move default lexicon strings from PGXN::Manager::Locale::en to
        PGXN::Manager::Locale so that other locales can take advantage of
        them. That is, Locale::fr does not inherit from Locale::en.

0.4.2 2010-10-22T20:50:49
      - Added credits to the About page.

0.4.1 2010-10-22T19:22:50
      - Changed error controller action so that it only sends email if called
        as an `ErrorDocument` middleware subrequest. This is to prevent bogus
        emails if people just hit its URL directly.

0.4.0 2010-10-22T19:21:50
      - Improved internal server error handling. Now errors will be sent to
        the alert email address.

0.3.0 2010-10-21T23:31:46
      - Added salutation to new user email.
      - Fixed a bunch of warnings emitted by the Perl code (found by turning
        on warnings in tests)
      - Added "How To" page and tweaked the "Contact", "About Us", and
        "Upload" pages, including appropriate links to "How To".

0.2.5 2010-10-20T23:06:48
      - Added descriptions of fields to the registration/profile form. Should
        make things less confusing to folks signing up. In response to a gripe
        from Damien Clochard.

0.2.4 2010-10-20T17:21:31
      - Fixed redirection after successful registration and password reset to
        go to the proper place.

0.2.3 2010-10-20T17:12:53
      - Built out the 500 error page, which is a static file, based on other
        error pages.
      - Fixed misspelling in the user registration alert email. Also added
        a link to the moderation UI.
      - Renamed `Request->login_uri` to `auth_uri`, and renamed the
        configuration setting to same.
      - Added `Request->auth_uri_for()` and updated places in the public site
        that link to the auth site to use it.
      - Moved the password reset form (to which a link is set when a new user
        account is accepted or a user fills in the forgotten password form) to
        the auth site, where it belongs. This is the only part of the auth
        site that does not require authentication.

0.2.2 2010-10-20T00:29:41
      - Added Error document support for production.
      - Fixed registration form URL to point to the right place.

0.2.1 2010-10-19T06:07:02
      - Added version, copyright, and license to footer.
      - Fixed display of form legends on Firefox so that they're not floating
        above the fieldset with which they're associated.

0.2.0 2010-10-19T04:19:54
      - Added build and installation instructions to `README.md`.
      - Added missing dependencies on Plack::Middleware::Session and
        Email::Address to `Build.PL`.
      - Added `conf/prod.json`. I think the usage will be pretty typical, and
        it will be nicer for folks just to have a file to edit.
      - Changed Archive::Extract error handling in PGXN::Manager::Distribution
        to always die with our custom erorr message, rather than try to parse
        the original error message, which can vary depending on the
        implementation of `tar`.
      - Fixed a test failure when looking at the sha1 in `t/distview.t`.
      - Fixed a test failure on Test::More 0.95_01 or higher when comparing a
        string to a string-overloaded Email::Address object. Just turn the
        Email::Address into a string to compare instead.
      - Initialize the mirror root on startup in `bin/pgxn_manager.psgi`.
      - User access time is now updated on authentication. Conveniently, the
        `authenticate_user()` function is called every time the user visits
        the site and is logged in.
      - Now using a subdirectory of the temp directory named
        "pgxn-session-$ENV{PLACK_ENV}" to store the session files. This
        prevents the polution of /tmp with a lot of junk.
      - Change mounts so that the public site is mounted under /pub/ and the
        auth site is mounted under /auth/. They are now effectively separate
        apps. This allows them to be separately reverse-proxied.
      - Rename `conf/prod.json` to `conf/local.json`. The `README` now says
        to copy this file to `conf/prod.json` and edit the copied file.
      - Added  `conf/proxied.json`. This will serve as an example for setting
        up PGXN::Manager to run behind a reverse proxy server.
      - Recommend Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy. I think it's likely that
        the app will usually be run behind a reverse proxy server.
      - Added the `uri_script_name_key` and `login_uri` configuration keys.
        They have useful defaults but should be tweaked if /pub/ and /auth/
        are behind separate reverse proxy servers.
      - Switched router to Router::Resource. It's more RESTy and also offers
        handling of 404s and 405s.
      - Copyright retroactively assigned exclusively to David E. Wheeler,
        rather than to both PostgreSQL Experts and David.
      - An email is now sent when a new user registers. This is so that admins
        can be quickly alerted to registrations and moderate them ASAP.

0.1.0 2010-10-08T01:51:55Z 
      - Initial version.
