Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Manager

0.1.1
      - Added build and installation instructions to `README.md`.
      - Added missing dependencies on Plack::Middleware::Session and
        Email::Address to `Build.PL`.
      - Added `conf/prod.json`. I think the usage will be pretty typical, and
        it will be nicer for folks just to have a file to edit.
      - Changed Archive::Extract error handling in PGXN::Manager::Distribution
        to always die with our custom erorr message, rather than try to parse
        the original error message, which can vary depending on the
        implementation of `tar`.
      - Fixed a test failure when looking at the sha1 in `t/distview.t`.
      - Fixed a test failure on Test::More 0.95_01 or higher when comparing a
        string to a string-overloaded Email::Address object. Just turn the
        Email::Address into a string to compare instead.

0.1.0 2010-10-08T01:51:55Z 
      - Initial version.
